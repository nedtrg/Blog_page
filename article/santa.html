    <h2>Why Project Santa?</h2>
    <p>
      The holiday season can be a lonely and difficult time for women struggling to provide for their families. Project Santa ensures no mother or caregiver is left out of the season of giving, by delivering food packs and festive essentials to homes in need.
    </p>

    <h3>Our Approach</h3>
    <ul class="styled-list">
      <li> Surprise festive food packs delivered before holidays</li>
      <li> Prioritizing homes led by women and caregivers</li>
      <li> Community nomination system to reach hidden struggles</li>
      <li> Empowering mothers to celebrate with dignity and joy</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Projects So Far</h3>

    <p>
      Since its launch, Project Santa has reached over <strong>500 women-led homes</strong> in underserved communities, bringing smiles and festive joy. From urban slums to rural villages, every delivery restores confidence and celebration to families often forgotten.

        <p>
      Every act of kindness reminds these families they are seen, they matter, and they are worthy of joyful moments—especially during seasons that should be about togetherness.
